# Java-Search Engine

Catherine Garner – C16371033.

For this assignment I choose to do ‘My Search Engine’. This is a program that allows the user to search for a word in multiple files and return the match from strongest to weakest. 
In my program the user can choose what files they wish to search in, there is no limit to the number of files. When the search button is clicked the files that the user choose are taken and the search word entered by the user is searched for in all the files. The results are then displayed from the strongest match to the weakest match. 
The user has the ability to remove a file from their chosen files list so this will no longer be included in their search.
The user is also able to search for wild card words by adding a * to the send of their search word. This will display the strongest to weakest match for their chosen word along with their chosen word with all the suffixes added on. 
The user can add suffixes to the lost so that when they do a wild card search more words are searched for.
By clicking the previous search words button the user can see all the words that they have searched for. They can also delete the previous searches.
